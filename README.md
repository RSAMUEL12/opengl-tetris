# Tetris for MacOS and Linux
This is my Computer Graphics Assignment: to build a Tetris game using C++ and the OpenGL rendering library and GLSL to create a Tetris game with pseudo-3D bump mapping textures and lighting shaders

In order to run this application, you must have either a MacOS or Linux operating system.

To compile the application, change into the directory and perform one of the two commands:
1. ln -fs Makefile.OSX Makefile (MacOS)
2. ln -fs Makefile.linux Makefile (Linux)

Then compile using: make main

Run the application using: ./main
